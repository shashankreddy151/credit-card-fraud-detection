## Project Description

The **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project aims to analyze and predict fraudulent transactions using a dataset of credit card transactions. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project focuses on identifying patterns and anomalies that signify potential fraud, thereby enhancing the payment experience in industries susceptible to fraudulent activities, such as e-commerce and banking.

Using Python, SQL, and various data analysis libraries, the project involves preprocessing transaction data, visualizing trends, and building predictive models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The ultimate goal is to optimize payment systems and improve security measures, contributing to a safer and more efficient customer experience.
